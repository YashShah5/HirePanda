ðŸ“ž Summary: Exploratory Call with Night-Shift DBA Team (India)
ðŸ—“ Date: [Insert Date]
ðŸ‘¤ Lead: Yash Shah
ðŸŽ¯ Purpose: Exploratory discussion with the DBA team to understand the current MongoDB setup and discuss HA (High Availability), monitoring, and backup strategies.

ðŸ§  Discussion Highlights:

â€¢ MongoDB servers recently went down unnoticed â€” no monitoring was in place.
â€¢ These servers are critical to ongoing project workloads (e.g. data migration).

âœ… Key Takeaways:

ðŸ”¹ Current Setup
â€¢ MongoDB is currently in standalone mode â€” no HA or failover.

ðŸ”¹ Monitoring
â€¢ DBA team can add monitoring + alerting once server names are shared.
â€¢ Metrics can be pushed to Datadog.

ðŸ”¹ High Availability (HA)
â€¢ DBA recommends converting to a 3-node replica set (auto-failover).
â€¢ No code changes needed â€” just update the connection string.
â€¢ Failover will happen automatically if one node goes down.

ðŸ”¹ Downtime Requirement
â€¢ Application downtime will be needed during migration to HA.
â€¢ DBA team will handle dump + restore.
â€¢ Coordination needed on timing from our side.

ðŸ”¹ Cross-Region HA
â€¢ MongoDB supports HA across regions.
â€¢ DBA team asked us to confirm: same-region or cross-region preference.

ðŸ”¹ Data Restore
â€¢ If backups arenâ€™t viable, data can be replayed from JSON/app-layer sources.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps (Assigned to Yash):
â€¢ ðŸ”¸ Share server names (PROD/TEST)
â€¢ ðŸ”¸ Confirm HA scope (prod only or prod + dev)
â€¢ ðŸ”¸ Confirm region preference (same vs. cross-region)
â€¢ ðŸ”¸ Submit detailed request email to DBA team to begin provisioning
(Note: VM setup may be delayed due to resource constraints)

ðŸ“Š Quick Summary Table:

â€¢ Monitoring: Needs server names; Datadog integration possible
â€¢ Current Mode: Standalone
â€¢ HA Option: 3-node replica set with auto-failover
â€¢ Code Impact: Only connection string needs update
â€¢ Downtime: Required during HA migration
â€¢ Region Decision: Confirm same-region vs. cross-region
â€¢ Next Steps: Submit request; DBA will review & proceed
