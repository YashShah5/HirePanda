Story 140:  

Story Purpose:
Whenever there is  a migration we can have validation of the commit tags so that we can ensure no data loss. My script is similar to the branches and commit checks we have in the migrations scripts folder. 

Flash the code:
Show a quick demo of the code. Run it and show it work

Output of the code:
Show the csv file after the code and show the ID and tag name where it failed 

Flash Documentation:
Show documentation and briefly go over the process again

Explain the need for a follow up story
 I have created a follow up story (story 261) to help make the code more industrialized and deployable (also to add any other features Turan and Rishi think would be good to add when it gets reviewed). 
A lot of the edge cases are done. 
Move code from non prod to prod 
Raise PR and merge
This story also has a subtask for nandita to do a QC check
 
Story 189: 

Show story: 
This story was created just to track my onboarding process and an enable me as an intern and enable me as as a devops member as well

Purpose of the documentation made: 
Go over two sets of documentation

Onboarding: 
Was used to track all new golinks and other useful intern help guides. I found sams onboarding document helpful so I think this was a great way to collect some important information about the company and the on boarding process
High level plan
Mostly for myself to work off of. I use it as a baseline for the metrics needed to reclassify different orgs from complex to medium.  
Plan to add different repo/org ids just to keep track of them
