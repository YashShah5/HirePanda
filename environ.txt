h2. Medium Criteria Summary
A GitHub repository may be classified as "Medium Complexity" if it meets most of the following:

| *Metric*       | *Threshold / Condition* |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Total Metadata | < 20,500                |
| Wiki           | Exists, no attachments  |
| Issues         | Exists, no attachments  |
| Pull Requests  | ≤ 10 open PRs           |
| Repo Size      | < 20 GB                 |
| Commit Size    | < 2 GB                  |
| Releases       | < 100 MB total assets   |

These thresholds are designed to balance performance and ease of automation. Orgs that fall within these limits are typically manageable without deep manual intervention.

| *Filter*           | *Why It’s Flagged*                         | *False Positive Example*                      | *Notes*                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Size Filtering     | Repo is large; may slow transfer/migration | A few large binary assets like PDFs or videos | Use Git LFS if needed; ignore inactive binary bloat |
| Branch Count       | >50 branches may imply complexity          | Mostly inactive branches                      | Clean up with `git branch --merged`                 |
| Commit Count       | >400 implies heavy history                 | Frequent bot commits                          | Use `git shortlog -sn` to audit                     |
| Webhooks           | Hooks require reconfiguration              | One unused webhook from years ago             | Remove unused hooks before migration                |
| Runners            | Self-hosted runners may not port easily    | Runner registered but never used              | Check runner job history                            |
| Actions            | Workflows need validation and secrets      | Linting-only or disabled workflows            | Look in `.github/workflows/`                        |
| Branch Protections | Require recreation in SaaS                 | Default rule on unused branch                 | List protections using GitHub API                   |
| Issues             | May require data preservation              | Issues exist but have no attachments          | Use external issue tracking tools                   |
| Pages              | Might need DNS/config porting              | Static site with default `.github.io` domain  | Low migration risk if unused                        |
| Releases           | Tagged builds may have large assets        | One old release with no assets                | Check total artifact size < 100MB                   |
| Wiki               | Needs to be migrated manually              | Empty wiki or 1-page wiki                     | Clone wiki repo via Git                             |
| Binary Files       | Git can’t delta-compress them well         | One image or PDF added years ago              | Enable Git LFS for frequent binaries                |
| Pull Requests      | Review state & comments must be preserved  | All PRs closed or inactive for years          | Export summaries instead of full data               |

h2. Summary
This medium complexity tier captures edge cases that were previously misclassified as "complex" but do not need high-touch manual effort. Use the table above to guide repo evaluation and prioritize migration sequencing.
