🟦 Benefits (Top Right)

Benefits of Medium Complexity Classification

    🔹 Reduced Support Load
    Offloads engineering oversight by enabling more orgs to self-serve

    🔹 Faster Migration Paths
    Eligible orgs skip manual review and proceed independently

    🔹 Improved Complexity Visibility
    Introduces a scalable “medium” tier between simple and complex

    🔹 Automation at Scale
    Classification logic applies consistently across all orgs

    🔹 Data-Driven Decision Making
    Thresholds are backed by real usage and metadata patterns

🟦 Future Steps (Bottom Right)

Next Steps & Future Opportunities

    📌 Cross-Team Validation
    Share logic with GitHub Infra, Support, and PDLM for alignment

    📌 Tooling Integration
    Embed classification logic into migration and pre-flight tools

    📌 Threshold Refinement
    Tune complexity cutoffs as more orgs and features evolve

    📌 Wiki & Attachment Checks
    Improve detection of hidden binary/data-heavy content

    📌 Metrics Dashboard
    Create a live dashboard to track org breakdown and rule coverage

🟦 Project Overview & Impact (Middle Right Box)

Project Overview

    Developed a reclassification system for GitHub orgs initially marked as “complex”

    Used metadata analysis and Python automation to identify a new “medium” tier

    Targeted goal: reduce unnecessary support load and enable self-serve migrations

My Impact

    ✅ Reclassified ~700 out of 1963 orgs (~35%) to medium complexity

    ✅ Built and deployed scripts for repo scanning and metadata evaluation

    ✅ Closed 10+ stories over 3 sprints, spanning automation, debugging, and reporting

    ✅ Worked with PDLM, Infra, and Support to validate filters and thresholds
